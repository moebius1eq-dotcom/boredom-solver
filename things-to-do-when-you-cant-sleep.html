    <h1>Things to Do When You Can't Sleep</h1>
    
    <p>Staring at the ceiling at 2 AM? Can't sleep but don't want to just lie there? We've all been there. Here are things to do when you can't sleep that won't leave you more tired tomorrow.</p>
    
    <h2>😴 Why Can't You Sleep?</h2>
    <p>Whether it's stress, anxiety, too much screen time, or just a racing mind - insomnia hits everyone. Instead of tossing and turning, try these activities.</p>
    
    <h2>🎮 Things to Do When You Can't Sleep</h2>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Play Idle Games</h3>
        <p>Low-effort games that play themselves are perfect when you're too tired to think but too awake to sleep. Perfect for those middle-of-the-night boredom moments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Listen to Podcasts or Audiobooks</h3>
        <p>Put on something boring (yes, really!) or a familiar comfort show. The distraction helps quiet your mind while being relaxing.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Read Something Boring</h3>
        <p>That textbook you've been putting off? Now's perfect. Dry technical manuals work wonders for making you sleepy.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Try Guided Meditation</h3>
        <p>Evening meditation and breathing exercises can help calm your mind. Try sleep meditations or simply focus on your breathing.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="activity">
        <h3>Plan Tomorrow</h3>
        <p>Make a mental list of what you need to do tomorrow. Getting it out of your head and onto "paper" can help stop the racing thoughts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>🧘 Sleep-Friendly Activities</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Progressive muscle relaxation</li>
        <li>Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 technique)</li>
        <li>Listening to ambient sounds or rain sounds</li>
        <li>Gentle stretching in bed</li>
        <li>Journaling your thoughts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>⚠️ What NOT to Do When You Can't Sleep</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Don't check your phone - the blue light makes it worse</li>
        <li>Don't watch exciting content - save the thrillers for daytime</li>
        <li>Don't stress about not sleeping - it makes it harder</li>
        <li>Don't drink caffeine after 2 PM</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Remember: if you can't sleep, getting up and doing something quiet is better than lying there stressing. These activities can help tire your brain without keeping you awake.</p>
