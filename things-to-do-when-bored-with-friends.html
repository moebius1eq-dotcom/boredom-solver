    <h1>Things to Do When Bored with Friends</h1>
    
    <p>Being bored with friends is a different kind of bored. You're together, you're hanging out, but nobody can agree on what to do. The Netflix password is being shared by someone who's not here, the restaurant is too far, and everyone is just... sitting there.</p>
    
    <p>Don't worry. BoredomSolver has compiled the ultimate list of things to do when you're bored with friends—all low-effort, all weird, and none of which involve productivity or calling anyone.</p>
    
    <h2>Weird Conversation Starters</h2>
    <p>When silence hits, throw one of these out there:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Would you rather...</strong> – Eat glass or smell like onions forever?</li>
        <li><strong>Hot takes</strong> – What's your most controversial opinion?</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrity rankings</strong> – Rank these 5 celebrities from hottest to ugliest.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypotheticals</strong> – What would you do if you woke up as a cat?</li>
        <li><strong>Two truths and a lie</strong> – Classic for a reason.</li>
        <li><strong>Desert island</strong> – What 3 things would you bring?</li>
        <li><strong>Most embarrassing moment</strong> – Share and cringe together.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Group Phone Activities</h2>
    <p>Everyone look at one screen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>YouTube rabbit hole</strong> – Put on a video essay. Let it autoplay.</li>
        <li><strong>Reddit deep dive</strong> – Find the weirdest post together.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Maps exploring</strong> – Pick a random country. Street view around.</li>
        <li><strong>TikTok share</strong> – Show your FYP to each other. Judge.</li>
        <li><strong>Wikipedia random</strong> – Read about something none of you understand.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Minimal Effort Group Activities</h2>
    <p>Things that require almost nothing from anyone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Judge people</strong> – Look out the window. Make up stories.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate things</strong> – Show a photo. Rate it 1-10.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a playlist</strong> – Add one song each. See what happens.</li>
        <li><strong>Order food</strong> – The ultimate group activity. Debate for 2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Take group nap</strong> – Everyone lie down. Very productive.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Text-Based Chaos</h2>
    <p>For when you're all in the same room but on your phones:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create a group chat</strong> – For "the vibe."</li>
        <li><strong>Send challenges</strong> – See who can complete the weirdest dare.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate each other</strong> – Give everyone a rating out of 10.</li>
        <li><strong>Share memes</strong> – The weirdest ones you have.</li>
        <li><strong>Text each other from across the room</strong> – Why not?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Things to Do When You Really Can't Agree</h2>
    <p>The friend group is fighting. Nothing sounds good. Try these:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nothing</strong> – Just sit there. Together.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch something bad</strong> – Find the worst movie. It's fun.</li>
        <li><strong>Go in a circle</strong> – Each person picks an activity. Vote.</li>
        <li><strong>Split up</strong> – Two people do one thing, others do another.</li>
        <li><strong>Rock paper scissors</strong> – For everything. Let fate decide.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Ultimate Bored With Friends Activity</h2>
    <p>When all else fails:</p>
    <p><strong>Exist in the same space.</strong> Sometimes friends don't need to do anything together. Sometimes just being in the same room, not talking, doing your own thing, is enough. Scroll your own phones. Stare at the ceiling. Be bored together.</p>
    
    <p>That's what friendship is about. Not forcing activities. Just... being there. Together. Bored.</p>
