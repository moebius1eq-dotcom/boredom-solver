    <h1>Fun 5-Minute Activities</h1>
    
    <p>Sometimes you don't have hours to waste. Sometimes you just need something to fill five minutes. Maybe you're waiting for something. Maybe you're in line. Maybe you just want to do a quick boredom fix before going back to doing nothing.</p>
    
    <p>These activities are designed to be quick, easy, and require zero setup. Five minutes is the perfect amount of time to waste on something completely pointless. Let's get into it.</p>

        <li><strong>Create a playlist</strong> – For a mood you don't have.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Quick Sensory Activities</h2>
    <p>Things to do with your senses without actually doing anything:</p>

        <li><strong>Check one email</strong> – Don't respond. Just check.</li>
        <li><strong>Drink water</strong> – Very low effort.</li>
        <li><strong>Open one work tab</strong> – Then close it immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Write one to-do item</strong> – That you'll never do.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Ultimate 5-Minute Activity</h2>
    <p>If you really have 5 minutes and nothing else to do:</p>
    <p><strong>Stare at something.</strong> That's it. Look at a wall. Look at your hands. Look at nothing. Let your mind go blank. Sometimes the most boring thing you can do is also the most relaxing.</p>
    
    <p>Five minutes is nothing. It's barely any time at all. But in those five minutes, you have the power to do absolutely nothing in a whole new way. Embrace the brevity. Waste those five minutes like they're the last five minutes you'll ever waste.</p>

    <p>Time is a construct. Use it poorly. 🧩</p>
